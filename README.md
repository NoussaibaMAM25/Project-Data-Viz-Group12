Project Title: Analysing Trends and Factors Impacting the Olympic Athletes’ Performance and Achievements Over the Past 120 Years.

The Olympics is a global event that brings together athletes from various countries, representing diverse backgrounds and showcasing their talents across multiple sports. This project aims to explore Trends and Factors Impacting the Olympic Athletes’ Performance and Achievements Over time. 

We will answer the following key questions:

1.	Are there noticeable trends in the demographics of Olympic athletes across different years and sports?
2.	How do these demographic factors influence medal achievements in different sports and events?
